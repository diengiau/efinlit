 test the CAPM.
 They find that 
\begin_inset Formula $beta$
\end_inset

 seems to relate to size of firms.
 In particular, small firms have higher returns compared to large firms.
 Thus, they control for size when create the beta factor in their 1992 paper.
 After control and re-test the joint roles of market beta, size, E/P, leverage,
 and B/M, they find that:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
When measured it unrelated to size, 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 is not related to stock returns, even when itâ€™s the only explanatory variable.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Used alone, size, E/P, leverage, and B/M equity have explanatory power
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Used combination, Size and B/M capture the cross-sectional variation of
 stock returns, and they reflect the multidimensional risks in asset pricing.
 What factors they proxy for? Distress risk or investment?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Leverage effect is related to B/M effect
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
\begin_inset Formula $E/P$
\end_inset

 effect weakens after we control 
\begin_inset Formula $size$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $B/M$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thus, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 find out two common factors: 
\begin_inset Formula $size$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $B/M$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "fama1993commonrisk"

\end_inset

 identifies 5 common risk factors in pricing stocks and bonds.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
For stocks: market factors, size, B/M
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
For bonds: maturity 
\emph on
TERM
\emph default
 (
\emph on
term structure
\emph default
 = long-term gov bond - one month T-bill rate) and default risk 
\emph on
DEF
\emph default
 (default premium = long-term corporate bond - long-term gov bond)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In 1993, they expand their old paper by adding bond assets and other factors
 to explain bond returns such as 
\emph on
term structure
\emph default
.
 In addition, instead of Fama-Macbeth approach, this paper uses Black, Jensen,
 Scholes (1972) time-series regression approach.
 Monthly stock and bond returns are regressed on the returns to a market
 portfolio of stocks and mimicking portfolio for size, B/M, and term structure
 risk factors in returns.
 The slopes are 
\emph on
factor loading or risk-factor sensitivities
\emph default
 for stocks and bonds.
 This method, later, will be the standard in testing factor models.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the model, the dependent variable is excess returns (stock and bond returns
 minus one-month Treasury bill rate).
 Bonds include 2 government bonds and 5 corporate bond portfolios.
 Stocks include 25 of 
\begin_inset Formula $5\times5$
\end_inset

 size-BM portfolios.
 The idea is if the intercept from three-factor regressions (excess market
 return, mimicking size, and mimicking B/M factors) are close to zero, the
 model seems to do good job to explaining the cross-section of average stock
 returns.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Multifactor explanations of asset pricing anomalies
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The main finding of 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "fama1996multifactor"

\end_inset

 is they propose 3-factor model (
\begin_inset Formula $FF3$
\end_inset

) to solve most of anomalies 
\emph on
except for momentum
\emph default
.
 The existing anomalies are: long-term reversal (DeBondt and Thaler, 1985),
 short-term momentum (Jegadeesh and Titman, 1993), size, B/M (Lakonishok,
 Shleifer, and Vishny, 1994), which cannot be explained by CAPM.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subparagraph
Form factors:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
At the end of June in year 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

, independently sort median ME of NYSE stocks and 3 groups of BE/ME (30-40-30%)
 of NYSE stocks.
 We got 6 portfolios.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Value-weighted monthly returns on portfolios are calculated from July year
 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 to June year 
\begin_inset Formula $t+1$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Two factors: 
\begin_inset Formula $SMB=\frac{SL+SM+SH}{3}-\frac{BL+BM+BH}{3}$
\end_inset

; 
\begin_inset Formula $HML=\frac{SH+BH}{2}-\frac{SL+BL}{2}$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Subparagraph
Three-factor models
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
R_{i}-R_{f}=a_{i}+b_{i}(R_{m}-R_{f})+s_{i}SMB+h_{i}HML+e
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If the three factors can proxy for all risk exposure to unobservable factors,
 we should see the intercepts are close to zero.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Fama and French often analyze by using two methods:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Two-way sort
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Run factor model regression of 10 deciles (sort based on the anomalies)
 then test GRS that all intercepts are zero.
 If we accept the null, meaning that FF3 could explain the anomaly because
 all intercepts are zero.
 For example, if they test B/M, they first sort sample to 10 deciles of
 B/M then run factor models for 10 portfolios.
 Then, they test all 10 intercepts are zero by GRS.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
A 5-factor model
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 update their model to include two more factors: investment and profitability.
 They propose a theoretical base that market value equity to book value
 equity of firms is:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{M_{t}}{B_{t}}=\frac{\sum_{\tau=1}^{\infty}E(Y_{t+\tau}-dB_{t+\tau})/(1+r)^{\tau}}{B_{t}}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
where Y is earning, B is book equity, 
\begin_inset Formula $dB_{t+\tau}=B_{t+\tau}-B_{t+\tau-1}$
\end_inset

 is change in book equity, 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

 is long-term average expected stock return.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subparagraph
Implications of the model is:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
M decreases and B/M increases: so stock returns 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

 increase
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
\begin_inset Formula $E(Y_{t+\tau})$
\end_inset

 increases (i.e., 
\series bold
profitability factor
\series default
) then stock returns 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

 increase
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
\begin_inset Formula $dB$
\end_inset

 increases (i.e., 
\series bold
investment factor
\series default
) then stock returns 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

 decreases
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The empirical model is:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
R_{i}-R_{f}=a_{i}+b_{i}(R_{m}-R_{f})+s_{i}SMB+h_{i}HML+r_{i}RMW+c_{i}CMA+e
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
where the new two factors are:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
RMW (robust minus weak profitability, as ROE)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
CMA (conservative minus aggressive investment, as asset growth)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
What factors that Fama-French model proxy for?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Innovations of variables relating to 
\emph on
investment opportunity
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is known that to some extent, 
\begin_inset Formula $SMB$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $HML$
\end_inset

 could explain some variation in cross-section returns.
 But Fama and French could not explain what are these factors proxy for.
 Specifically, FF (1993) suggest that HML and SMB might proxy for state
 variables that describe 
\emph on
time variation in the investment opportunity set
\emph default
.
 Fama and French (1996) argue that the SMB and HML factors of the Fama and
 French (1993) model proxy for financial distress.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Petkova (2006-JF) propose an idea that these factors are correlated with
 
\series bold
\emph on
innovations 
\series default
(i.e., changes)
\emph default
 in variables that describe investment opportunities.
 In other words, the FF model is consistent with an ICAPM explanation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In literature, some empirical findings show that FF factors relate to macroecono
mic variables and business cycle fluctuations (FF factors predict future
 GDP growth or consumption growth).
 In this paper, Petkova uses a set of relevant state variables such as 
\series bold
\emph on
short-term T-bill, term spread, aggregate dividend yield, and default spread
\series default
\emph default
.
 These state variables are chosen to model 
\emph on
two aspects
\emph default
 of the investment opportunity set, namely, 
\series bold
\emph on
the yield curve
\series default
\emph default
 and the 
\series bold
\emph on
conditional distribution of asset returns
\series default
\emph default
.
 In this paper, she does not assume that HML and SMB have predictive abilities
 for the excess market return.
 Rather, they proxy for innovations (i.e., changes) in variables that possess
 such ability.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A factor model with excess market return and innovations in the aggregate
 dividend yield, term spread, default spread, and one-month T-bill yield
 has a higher explanatory power than the FF three-factor model.
 FF factors are not significant explanatory variables for the cross-section
 of average returns in the presence of these innovation factors.
 Furthermore, this suggestive ICAPM model could be able to account for common
 timevarying patterns in returns (conditional asset pricing model).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph

\series bold
What is ICAPM framework
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
According to 
\series bold
(Merton, 1973)
\series default
, if investment opportunities change over time, then assetsâ€™ exposures to
 these changes are important determinants of average returns in addition
 to the market beta.
 So, Petkova looks at the innovations in state variables that capture uncertaint
y about investment opportunities in the future.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
R_{it}=a_{i}+\beta_{iM}R_{Mt}+\sum(\beta_{i,u^{K}})u_{t}^{K}+e_{it}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
where 
\begin_inset Formula $R_{i}$
\end_inset

 is returns on 25 portfolios sorted by 
\begin_inset Formula $5\times5$
\end_inset

 size and B/M, 
\begin_inset Formula $R_{M}$
\end_inset

 is excess market return, 
\begin_inset Formula $u^{K}$
\end_inset

 is the innovation to state variable K.
 The innovation is the unexpected component of the variable.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For state variables, she adopts a VAR model that demeanded vector 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{t}$
\end_inset

 follows a first-order VAR as 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{t}=Az_{t-1}+u_{t}$
\end_inset

, where the residual 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{t}$
\end_inset

 is the innovation terms and is also the risk factor in the model above.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
More details about state variables: choose a set of state variables to model
 two aspects of the investment opportunity set, these are
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
To capture 
\emph on
yield curve slope
\emph default
: short-term T-bill yield (RF) and the term spread (TERM) 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
To capture 
\emph on
conditional distribution of asset returns
\emph default
: aggregate dividend yield (DIV), the default spread (DEF), and interest
 rates
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
She also adds SMB and HML of Fama-French as a comparison.
 Thus, the FF3 model is also adopted as a competing asset pricing model.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Default risk
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Vassalou and Xing (2004) use Merton (1974) option pricing model to calculate
 default measure of individual firms.
 They find that size effect is a 
\emph on
default effect
\emph default
, and this is also largely true for the book-to-market (BM) effect.
 The size effect 
\emph on
exists only
\emph default
 within the quintile with the 
\emph on
highest default risk
\emph default
, which the spread between small and big firms is 45%/year.
 In the highest default risk quintile, the B/M spread is 30%/year.
 In low default risk segments, the size effect and B/M effects disappear.
 Small and value stocks have higher default risk than big and growth stocks
 and the relation is monotonic.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In addition, they find that high default-risk firms earn higher returns
 than low default-risk firms, only for small and high BM firms.
 It is clear that the highest returns are earned by stocks that are either
 both small in size and high default risk (DLI), or both high DLI and high
 BM.
 Finally, they find that default risk is systematic and therefore priced
 in the cross section of equity returns.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Famaâ€“French (FF) factors SMB and HML 
\emph on
contain some default-related information
\emph default
, but this is 
\emph on
not the main reason
\emph default
 that the FF model can explain the cross section of equity returns.
 SMB and HML appear to 
\emph on
contain important priced information
\emph default
, unrelated to default risk.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While in literature, default risk on equities focus on default spread (long-term
 BAA corporate bonds minus long-term AAA or US Treasury bonds) from bond
 market, they estimate the 
\emph on
default likelihood indicators (DLI) 
\emph default
from equity data.
 In Merton model, equity of a firm is viewed as a call option on firm asset.
 Because equity holders are residual claimants on the firmâ€™s assets after
 all other obligations have been met.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{A}$
\end_inset

 is assets value, 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

 is book value of debt, market value of equity is the call option of 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{A}$
\end_inset

 with time to expiration equal to T.
 Apply the Black and Scholes (193) model:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
V_{E}=V_{A}N(d_{1})-Xe^{-rT}N(d_{2})
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
where r is risk-free rate, N is cdf of the standard normal distribution.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The default probability is the probability that the firm assets will be
 less than the book value of firm liabilities.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
P_{def}=Pr\left(V_{A}\leq X|V_{A}\right)=Pr(ln(V_{A})\leq ln(X_{t})|V_{A})
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And distance to default: 
\begin_inset Formula $DD=\frac{ln(V_{A}/X)+\left(\mu-\frac{1}{2}\sigma_{A}^{2}\right)T}{\sigma_{A}\sqrt{T}}$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Default occurs when the 
\emph on
ratio of the value of assets to debt is less than 1
\emph default
, or its log is negative.
 The DD tells us by 
\emph on
how many standard deviations
\emph default
 the log of this ratio needs to 
\emph on
deviate from its mean
\emph default
 in order for default to occur.

Test of CAPM
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The CAPM could be written as 
\begin_inset Formula $R_{i}=\alpha_{i}+\beta_{i}R_{M}+e_{i}$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $R_{i}$
\end_inset

 is excess return.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In classical papers, first, authors run time-series regression to get 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{\beta}_{i}$
\end_inset

 for each individual stock.
 Second, they rund cross-sectional regression 
\begin_inset Formula $R_{i}=\gamma_{0}+\gamma_{1}\hat{\beta}_{i}+v_{i}$
\end_inset

 and test if 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{\gamma}_{0}=0$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{\gamma}_{1}=\bar{R}_{M}$
\end_inset

 However, there are several problems with this test:

\begin_layout Itemize
Lacking power in tests
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
Black, Jensen, and Scholes (1972)

 attempt to solve these problems by: (i) group stocks based on beta, (ii)
 use instrument variable which is closey related to current beta but can
 be independently observed (past beta); and (iii) increase number of observation
 (use monthly return over longer time period).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They propose a time series regression method that:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
First, use past 5 years to run regression and estimate the beta: 
\begin_inset Formula $R_{i}=\alpha_{i}+\beta_{i}R_{M}+e_{i}$
\end_inset

 Use this beta to sort stocks to 10 portfolios.
 Repeat for 35 years.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Second, run a time series regressions for each of 10 portfolios: 
\begin_inset Formula $R_{i}=\alpha_{i}+\beta_{i}R_{M}+e_{i}$

BJS (1972) support the Black-version of CAPM.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Next, in 
\series bold
Fama and Matbeth (1973)
\series default
, they also support the CAPM.
 Their method is a 3-step method:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
First, use 7 years (formation period) to find beta and sort stocks into
 20 beta portfolios
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Second, use next 5 years (estimation period) to estimate

 as standard deviation of residuals
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Then take average of 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta_{i}$
\end_inset

 of each portfolio as 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{\beta}_{p}$
\end_inset

 and

\end_inset


\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Repeat for next 3 years, adding one more year in estimation period
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Finally, they have a time-series of 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset

 and they want to test:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper

\begin_inset Formula $\gamma_{0}=r_{f}$

\begin_layout Standard
The results support CAPM as their predictions in hypotheses, just using
 a t-test to test.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Fama and French (1992) apply a Fama-Macbeth process to test the CAPM.
 They find that the beta appears to be related to size.
 Thus, they control size when create the beta.
 Their results show that:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Even when it is the only explanatory variable, beta fails to explain the
 cross-section returns.
 This rejects the CAPM.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The main factors affect cross-section returns are size and BE/ME.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Other factors such as leverage and E/P lose their explanatory powers after
 controlling for size and BE/ME

\begin_layout Paragraph
ICAPM and APT: are they the same?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is quite an interesting question.
 We refer the Chapter 9 of Cochrane (2005) and Chapter 6 of Campbell et
 al.
 (1997) to answer this question.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
APT is more general than CAPM because it allows for multiple risk factors.
 APT assumes that the market is competitive and frictionless so return of
 asset is:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
R_{i} & = & a_{i}+b'_{i}f+e_{i}\\
E[e_{i}|f] & = & 0\\
E[e_{i}^{2}] & = & \sigma_{i}^{2}=\Sigma
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The factors 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

 account for the common variation in asset returns so that the disturbance
 term 
\begin_inset Formula $e$
\end_inset

 for large well-diversified portfolios vanishes.
 Thus, there is a SDF 
\begin_inset Formula $m=a+b'f$
\end_inset

 which linear in f and prices the returns.
 Chen, Roll, and Ross (1986) use financial theory to add some factors to
 model: maturity spread, inflation, industrial production, default spread.
 The results show that some notable factors affect stock returns include:
 market return, industrial production growth, unanticipated inflation, change
 in risk premium, yield curve.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
ICAPM model is proposed by Merton (1973) that the conditional distribution
 of returns delivers a multifactor model.
 The current wealth (market return) is one factor and state variables serve
 as additional factors.
 The state variables are factors arise from investors' demand to hedge uncertain
ty about future investment opportunities.
 Petkova (2006) again revisits the ICAPM and propose a set of innovations
 from state variables.
 She chooses some state variables to explain two properties of the change
 in growth opportunities: yield curve slope (risk free and term spread)
 and conditional distribution of the asset returns (aggregate dividend yield,
 default spread, and interest rate).
 Using a VAR model: 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{t}=Az_{t-1}+u_{t}$
\end_inset

, then 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{t}$
\end_inset

 is the residuals are used as the innovations of the state variables.
 Then she propose a model:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
R_{it}=a_{i}+\beta_{im}R_{mt}+\sum(\beta_{i,u^{k}})u_{t}^{k}+e_{it}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
and use this model to compare with FF3.
 She proves that her model perform better than the conventional FF3 model.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Although they are quite similar, APT and ICAPM have some distinguished propertie

The Chen, Roll, Ross (1986) describle itself as an APT but the factors are
 from financial literature, so it is more likely an ICAPM model.
 In Fama and French (1993), they propose that SMB and HML proxy for state
 variables that describe time variation in the investment opportunity set
 (quite similar to ICAPM).
 However, Fama and French (1996) construct model from sort returns based
 on factors, so it is more likely an APT model rather than an ICAPM.

A short review of CAPM and factor model
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Classical CAPM
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Markowitz (1958) laid a very first groundwork for CAPM.
 He proposes that investors would optimally hold a mean-variance frontier
 portfolio: a portfolio gives the highest expected return for a given level
 of variance.
 Sharpe (1964) and Lintner (1965) develope this idea that if investors are
 homogeneous expectations and optimally hold mean-variance frontier portfolios,
 then the market portfolio will be itself a mean-variance portfolio.
 The Sharpe-Lintner CAPM model is:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
E[R_{i}] & = & R_{f}+\beta_{im}\left(E[R_{m}]-R_{f}\right)\\
\beta_{im} & = & cov\left(R_{i},R_{m}\right)/var(R_{m})
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
where the 
\begin_inset Formula $R_{m}$
\end_inset

 is return on market portfolio, 
\begin_inset Formula $R_{f}$
\end_inset

 is risk-free rate.
 The model could be written in excess return too:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
E[R_{i}-R_{f}]=\beta_{im}\left(E[R_{m}]-R_{f}\right)
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Black (1972) propose a more general Black-version CAPM:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
E[R_{i}]=R_{0m}+\beta_{im}\left(E[R_{m}]-E[R_{0m}]\right)
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
where 
\begin_inset Formula $R_{0m}$
\end_inset

 is return on zero-beta portfolio associated with m.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Early empirical evidence
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Early evidence such as Black, Jensen, Scholes (1972) and Fama and Macbeth
 (1973) support the CAPM.
 Using time-series regression approach for 10 beta-sort portfolios, Black,
 Jensen, Scholes (1972) support the CAPM.
 Fama and Macbeth (1973) use a cross-section method to test the CAPM.
 Their method includes two main steps:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
For each 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 in 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

 periods, assuming beta is known, run a cross-section regression: 
\begin_inset Formula $E[R_{i}-R_{f}]=\gamma_{0t}+\gamma_{1t}\beta_{im}$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Given the time series of estimates 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma_{0t}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma_{1t}$
\end_inset

, use an usual t-test that 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma_{0}=0$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma_{1}>0$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
t-statistic=\frac{\bar{\hat{\gamma}}_{j}}{s(\hat{\gamma}_{j})}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Again, their evidence supports the CAPM.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Anomalies
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, CAPM fails to explain stock returns of some portfolio formed from
 specific factors.
 First, Fama and French (1992) find that beta tends to be related to size,
 small stocks earn higher returns than large stocks.
 Thus, they control for size when forming the beta.
 Then, applying the Fama-Macbeth procedure, they find that beta cound not
 explain the cross-section returns, even when it is the only explanatory
 variable.
 However, size and ratio of book equity to market equity (B/M) have significant
 power to exlain stock returns.
 Other factors (such as leverage, earning E/P) fail to explain stock returns,
 after controlling size and B/M.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Debondt and Thaler (1985) find a long-term reversal in stock returns, while
 Jegadeesh and Titman (1993) find a short-term momentum.
 Momentum effect refers to a portfolio formed by buying past winners and
 selling past losers has a higher average return than the CAPM predicts.
 Lakonishok, Shleifer, and Vishny (1994) find the value premium that value
 stocks outperform the growth stocks.
 Value stocks refer to stock with low price relative to fundamental value
 such as high B/M, E/P, C/P (cash), and low SG (sale growth).
 Thus, a contrarian strategy that sells growth stocks and buys value stocks
 could earn positive returns.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Factor models
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Fama and French (1993) show 5 common risk factors to explain equity return
 and bond return.
 For stock returns, they propose three factors: market excess return, size,
 and B/M.
 For government and corporate bond return, they propose two additional factors
 for maturity spread (TERM) and default spread (DEF).
 Using a time-series approach as in Black, Jensen, Scholes (1972), they
 find that these mimicking factors formed based on these factors can capture
 stock return and bond return.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Fama and French (1996) again use the 3 factor model (hereafter FF3) includes
 market excess return, size, and B/M to explain anomalies in literature.

The idea is if the FF3 can explain the portfolio return of anomalies, the
 intercept will be close to zero.
 The FF3 successfully explain size, B/M, and long-term reversal anomalies,
 but fail to explain the momentum.
 Thus, Carhart (1997) add momentum and construct a 4-factor Carhart model:

Conditional CAPM

\begin_layout Standard
While traditional CAPM assumes a static beta, Jagannathan and Wang (1996)
 relax two assumptions: (i) allow beta and market premium depend on a set
 of information at specific time point and vary over time and (ii) add an
 additional human capital return together with market return.
 Their model is as follows:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
E[R_{i}]=c_{0}+c_{size}ln(ME)+c_{vw}\beta^{vw}+c_{prem}\beta^{prem}+c_{labor}\beta^{labor}

Next question is which factors that FF3 proxies for? This question is quite
 interesting because in Fama and French (1993), they propose that SMB and
 HML proxy for state variables that describe time variation in the investment
 opportunity set (quite similar to ICAPM).
 Fama and French (1996) argue that SMB and HML might proxy for financial
 distress.

APT and ICAPM
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ross (1976) propose the APT model that its factors 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

 account for the common variation in asset returns so that the disturbance
 term 
\begin_inset Formula $e$
\end_inset

 for large well-diversified portfolios vanishes.
 Thus, there is a SDF 
\begin_inset Formula $m=a+b'f$
\end_inset

 which linear in f and prices the returns.
 Chen, Roll, and Ross (1986) use financial theory to add some factors to
 model: maturity spread, inflation, industrial production, default spread.
 The results show that some notable factors affect stock returns include:
 market return, industrial production growth, unanticipated inflation, change
 in risk premium, yield curve.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Vassalou and Xing (2004) use default risk to check whether FF3's factors
 proxy for default risk.
 They find that size effect and B/M effect exist only in subsample of stocks
 with high default risk.
 In addition, the stock with high default risk earn higher stock return
 than those with low default risk only in subsample of small stock or high
 B/M ratio.
 They conclude that FF3 contain some default-related information but they
 don't reject the FF3.
 They argue that FF3 contain other important priced information that unrelated
 to default risk.

\begin_layout Standard
Merton (1973) proposes the ICAPM model that is a multifactor model that
 includes current wealth (market return) and other factors explain the future
 investment opportunities.
 Petkova (2006) applies this idea to extract the innovations 
\begin_inset Formula $u^{K}$
\end_inset

 from state variables that describle the yield curve (risk free and TERM)
 and conditional distribution of asset returns (interest rate, aggregate
 dividend yield DIV, and default spread DEF).
 Then she propose an ICAPM:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
R_{it}=a_{i}+\beta_{im}R_{mt}+\sum(\beta_{i,u^{k}})u_{t}^{k}+e_{it}
\]

and use this model to compare with FF3.
 She proves that her model perform better than the conventional FF3 model.

 Fama and French (2015) finally add two additional factor profitability
