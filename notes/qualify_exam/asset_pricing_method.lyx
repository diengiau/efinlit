\begin_layout Standard
The main finding of 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 is they propose 3-factor model (
\begin_inset Formula $FF3$
\end_inset

) to solve most of anomalies 
\emph on
except for momentum
\emph default
.
 The existing anomalies are: long-term reversal (DeBondt and Thaler, 1985),
 short-term momentum (Jegadeesh and Titman, 1993), size, B/M (Lakonishok,
 Shleifer, and Vishny, 1994), which cannot be explained by CAPM.

\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If the three factors can proxy for all risk exposure to unobservable factors,
 we should see the intercepts are close to zero.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Fama and French often analyze by using two methods:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Two-way sort
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Run factor model regression of 10 deciles (sort based on the anomalies)
 then test GRS that all intercepts are zero.
 If we accept the null, meaning that FF3 could explain the anomaly because
 all intercepts are zero.
 For example, if they test B/M, they first sort sample to 10 deciles of
 B/M then run factor models for 10 portfolios.
 Then, they test all 10 intercepts are zero by GRS.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subparagraph
GRS test is the F-statistic of Gibbons, Ross, Ahanken (1989)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The null hypothesis is all intercepts of regressions are all zero.
 If the 3-factor model could explain the anomaly, all intercepts seem to
 be zero, so if we see GRS test accepts the null hypothesis, it means that
 the model could explain the anomaly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The evidence shows that GRS test could not reject null in long-term reversal
 an B/M anomalies, but reject the momentum effect, meaning that the model
 could not explain the momentum anomaly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "fama1996multifactor"

\end_inset

 show that the model fails to explain momentum because the short-term losers'
 returns load more on SMB and HML (behave more like small distressed stocks)
 than winners.
 Thus, the model predicts a reversal for the short-term losers (or the model
 can explain a mean-reversal) but fails to explain the observed continuation.
 This explanation seems to be a dumb one, I think.

Classic explanation: extrapolation (overreaction) and risk
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "lakonishok1994contrarian"

\end_inset

 propose two contrasting hypotheses to explain why value stocks earn abnormal
 returns:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Overreaction/extrapolation: investors seem to overreact to good news and
 believe that past successful perfromance will continue
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Risk: value stocks have higher fundamental risks, so they have higher returns
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The evidence supports the behavioral view.
 Contrarian strategy (buy value, sell glamour) should earn positive returns.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subparagraph
Their method
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Proxies of value stocks: BE/ME; C/P (cash/price), E/P (earning/price), and
 GS (growth in sale).
 For GS, remember that low GS is value stocks and high GS is glamour stocks.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
One-way sort: sort stocks to 10 groups of value measures (e.g., B/M) then
 take value-weighted returns for each groups.
 Then they compare between V-G (value-glamour) between high B/M (value)
 and low B/M (glamour).
 The results show that value stocks outperform glamour stocks.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Two-way sort: sort B/M and GS.
 A high B/M and low GS is most value stocks, while a low B/M and high GS
 is the most glamour stocks.
 Results show that the most value stocks earn highest returns, while the
 most glamour stocks earn lowest returns.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Extrapolation test: to prove that the past success will not persist in the
 future.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
They want to test whether the past successful performance will persist in
 the future
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
They compare the past- and future- performance between glamour stocks (BM1,
 CP1, or GS3) and value stocks (BM10, CP3, GS1)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
In the past (-5;0): glamour stocks have higher fundamental ratio (E/P, C/P,
 B/M) than value stocks
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
In the future (0;5): all tend to reverse, glamour stocks underperform than
 value stocks
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
It means that the past succeed will not continue in the future
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Whether contrarian strategy is riskier?
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Whether the contrarian strategy perform worse during recession? No.
 
\begin_inset Formula $Value-Glamour$
\end_inset

 return seem to positive in most of the time.
 In all recession year (NBER) and declined year (equal-weighted CRSP return
 declines), V-G always positive.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
When the split sample based on market performance and re-apply two-way sorting
 of B/M (or C/P, E/P) and GS, the V-G is again positive in all sub-sample
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
They also first one-way sort and two-way sort to define the value and glamour
 stocks, then they compare risks such as 
\begin_inset Formula $beta$
\end_inset

 and standard deviation (rather than portfolio returns as in main test).
 The contrarian strategy is not more risks than the naive strategy (or extrapola
tion strategy).
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Section
Spanning test
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The idea of spanning test is we want to test whether adding a new set 
\begin_inset Formula $K$
\end_inset

 of risky assets to an existing set 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 could enlarge the mean-variance frontier.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Consider K basis assets with returns 
\begin_inset Formula $R_{1t}$
\end_inset

 and N test assets with returns 
\begin_inset Formula $R_{2t}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
R_{t} & = & \left[R_{1t}^{'},R_{2t}^{'}\right]\, and\,\mu=E[R_{t}]=\left[\begin{array}{c}
\mu_{1}\\
\mu_{2}
\end{array}\right]\\
V & = & Var[R_{t}]=\left[\begin{array}{cc}
V_{11} & V_{12}\\
V_{21} & V_{22}
\end{array}\right]
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Project 
\begin_inset Formula $R_{2t}$
\end_inset

 on 
\begin_inset Formula $R_{1t}$
\end_inset

 we have to run regression: 
\begin_inset Formula $R_{2t}=\alpha+\beta R_{1t}+e_{t}$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
then 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha=\mu_{2}-\beta\mu_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta=V_{21}V_{11}^{-1}\varSigma=V_{22}-V_{21}V_{11}^{-1}V_{12}$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The null hypothesis:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
H_{0}:\alpha=0_{N}\, and\,\delta=1_{N}-\beta1_{K}=0_{N}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Intuitively, if the null holds, the basis assets K have same mean as every
 test assets N, but with smaller variance.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The mean-variance spanning test is actually the test of whether N test assets
 have zero weight in these two portfolios that lie on the minimum-variance
 frontier.
 By 
\emph on
\bar under
two fund separation
\emph default
\bar default
, if the above holds, every portfolio on the minimum-variance frontier will
 have zero weight on N test assets, i.e., no expansion by adding the N test
 assets into K basis assets.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The test statistics:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
W & = & T(\lambda_{1}+\lambda_{2})\sim\chi_{2N}^{2}\\

\begin_layout Standard
where 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{1}$

\begin_layout Subsection
Application 1: International Diversification from Domestic assets
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The idea in 
\series bold
Erruza, Hogan, Hung (1999)
\series default
 is that if we hold a home-made diversification from US assets (domestic
 assets), adding a foreign asset (foreign market indices) does not add benefits
 to the domestic assets.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We have:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Basis/benchmark assets: home-made (i.e., domestic traded) Diversification
 portfolios using US market indices, 12 US industry portfolios, 30 multinational
 corporations (MNCs), close-end country funds (CFs), and American Depositary
 Recepts (ADRs).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Test assets: 7 developed markets (DMs) and 9 emerging markets (EMs)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To select the basis assets (
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

benchmark assets
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in paper), they propose some restrictions when select the assets:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Limit the number of assets in each set to 4
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Choose 4 assets that maximize the probability of not rejecting spanning
 (null hypothesis)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The regression of the test: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
R_{I,t}=\alpha_{i}+\beta_{1}R_{e1,t}+\beta_{2}R_{e2,t}+\beta_{3}R_{e3,t}+\beta_{4}R_{e4,t}+e_{I,t}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
where 
\begin_inset Formula $R_{I}$
\end_inset

 is return on 
\emph on
I
\emph default
th foreign index, 
\begin_inset Formula $R_{e}$
\end_inset

 is 4 benchmark assets.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The null hypothesis is:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\alpha_{i} & = & 0\\
\sum_{i=1}^{4}\beta_{i} & = & 1
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They call the spanning test here is Huberman-Kandel test.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The higher 
\begin_inset Formula $p-value$
\end_inset

, we cannot reject null hypothesis.
 It means that adding the foreign assets does not enhance the benefits to
 the existing home-made diversification portfolio.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
However, it the 
\begin_inset Formula $p-value$
\end_inset

 is small and we could reject the null hypothesis.
 It means that adding the foreign assets improve the benefits to the existing
 home-made diversification portfolio.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Moreover, while spanning test checks the statistical significance, the economic
 significance could be tested from the shift in Sharpe ratio.
 The idea is if the spanning test is rejected, but the Sharpe ratio increases
 too small, it will not economic significance.
 Bekaert and Urias use Monte Carlo simulation and find that changes in Sharpe
 ratio of less than 0.057 are not economic significant.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If applied this cut-points, only adding Chile and Thailand indices to domestic
 traded diversification portfolio could bring benefits.
 Based on this result, Erruza, Hogan, Hung (1999) conclude that the economic
 gains from international diversification that cannot be obtained with domestica
lly traded securities, with few exceptions, are minimal.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Application 2: Diversification from Small-Caps
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Eun, Huang, Lai (2008) propose that adding the small-cap funds could benefits
 the diversification portfolios of 10 MSCI indices.
 In other words, they want to test if small-cap funds (CBF) can be spanned
 by MSCI country indices.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Basis assets: 10 MSCI indices
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Test assets: small-cap funds from countries
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The model:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
R_{i}=\alpha_{i}+\beta_{i}^{AU}MSCI^{AU}+...+\beta_{i}^{US}MSCI^{US}+e_{i}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
where 
\begin_inset Formula $R_{i}$
\end_inset

 is return on the small-cap fund from 
\emph on
i 
\emph default
th country, 
\begin_inset Formula $MSCI^{AU}$
\end_inset

 denotes the return from MSCI Australia country index, 
\begin_inset Formula $MSCI^{US}$
\end_inset

 for US, and so on.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The null hypothesis:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\alpha_{i} & = & 0\\
\sum_{i=1}^{10}\beta_{i} & = & 1
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The results show that almost in all case, the spanning test is rejected
 at conventional significance levels.
 It means that small-ap funds are indeed unique and investors may benefit
 from adding small-cap funds to their portfolio of country indices.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Mean-variance intersection test
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Using the same setting as in Spanning test, the intersection is when the
 original mean-variance frontier and the new mean-variance frontier have
 only 
\series bold
one point
\series default
 in common.
 The null is:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
H_{0}:\alpha-\eta(1-\beta1_{K})=0
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
where 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta$
\end_inset

 is risk-free rate.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The idea here is whether the new mean-variance frontier has
\emph on
 higher maximum attainable Sharpe ratio (or enhance the mean-variance efficiency
)
\emph default
 than the original mean-variance frontier.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The test statistic is: 
\begin_inset Formula $F=T\frac{\hat{\theta}_{2}(\eta)^{2}-\hat{\theta}_{1}(\eta)^{2}}{1+\hat{\theta}_{1}(\eta)^{2}}$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
where T is number of observations, 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{\theta}_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{\theta}_{2}$
\end_inset

 are maximum Sharpe ratios attainable by benchmark assets (original frontier)
 and benchmark plus test assets (new frontier).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The null hypothesis is maximum Sharpe ratio attainable with new assets is
 the same as that attainable with the benchmark assets.
 Thus, if we could reject the null, it means that adding new assets tends
 to enhance the maximum Sharpe ratio of the portfolio of original assets.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Application in Small-Caps
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In Eun, Huang, Lai (2008), they use the mean-variance intersection test
 to check whether adding small-cap funds could help to enhance the mean-variance
 efficiency of a benchmark diversification portfolio.
 The benchmark portfolio includes MSCI country indices.
 While the new portfolio (augmented diversification portoflio) add the small-cap
 funds.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Their intersection test statistic is a little different: 
\begin_inset Formula $F=\frac{T-(K+N)}{N}\frac{\hat{\theta}_{2}(\eta)^{2}-\hat{\theta}_{1}(\eta)^{2}}{1+\hat{\theta}_{1}(\eta)^{2}}$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
where K is number of benchmark assets (number of MSCI indices equals 10)
 and N is number of new assets.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The asymptotic distribution of the test statistic is:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
If short sale is allowed: 
\begin_inset Formula $F\sim F\, dist(T-K-N,N)\, d.f$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
If short sale is 
\emph on
not allowed
\emph default
: they use simulation to approximate the distribution
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the results, they find that the adding the small-cap funds could improve
 the Sharpe ratio.
 In every case, they can reject the null hypothesis (small 
\emph on
p-
\emph default
value of F test in last two rows of Table 5) in both short sale allowed
