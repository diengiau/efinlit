 find that the US firms hold more and more cash over time.
 This increase in cash could be explained by two motives: 
\emph on
agency problem
\emph default
 and 
\emph on
precautionary motive
\emph default
.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
First, firms tend to increase cash because they are less likely to pay dividends
 in an influential paper of 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "fama2001disappearing"

\end_inset

.
 This evidence seems to consistent with the agency theory.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "jensen1986agencycost"

\end_inset

 argue that entrenched CEOs tend to hold more cash instead of paying out
 to shareholders when they have poor investment opportunities.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Second, this increase in cash is also consistent with some change in firm
 characteristics such as: firms' cash flows are more volatile, firms hold
 less inventories and account receivables, and they invest more in R&D relative
 to capital expenditure over time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To distinguish between these two views, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "bates2009whydo"

\end_inset

 adopt two smart tests:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
First, they consider the increase in cash of firms in the top highest G-index
 quintile and the lowest G-index quintile.
 The agency predicts that firms in high G-index quintile should increase
 cash more but the empirical result contradicts to this prediction.
 In particular, all G-index quintile see the increase in cash holdings,
 but the increase in more pronounced among firms in the lowest G-index quintile.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Second, if the agency motive is true, we should see the increase in cash
 holding is negatively associated with firm value.
 Again, the empirical result is contrast to the prediction.
 Increase in cash holding indeed has positive impact on firm value.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph*
Cash increase and refinancing risk
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "harford2014refinancing"

\end_inset

 propose another reason to explain why firms hold more cash: to prevent
 refinancing risk for short debt maturity.
 If lenders give a firm a short maturity loan, firms need to hold more cash
 to mitigate the refinancing concern.
 Applying the cash-cash flows sensitivity of 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "almeida2004thecash"

\end_inset

 that financial constrained firms save more cash from cash flows for future
 investment, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "harford2014refinancing"

\end_inset

 show that firms in the top quintile of long-run debt due in 3 years save
 well over 5 cents per dollar of cash flows in comparison to only 3.4 cents
 per dollar of cash flows for an average firm.
 They also find a shorted debt maturity for the US firms over time, which
 is consistent with the time series of cash holdings in

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With respect to value of cash holding and refinancing risk, following

, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 regress firm value on change in cash reserve, refinancing risk, and their
 interaction.
 They find that the estimated coefficient of the interaction is positive,
 so higher cash helps to mitigate the risk of refinancing.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This evidence could relate to our work in managerial ability and bank loans.
 We could not find significant positive relation between loan maturity and
 managerial ability.
 In our working paper, we also find that firms with high-ability CEOs seem
 to have less financial constraints.

Agency evidence

However, we still find some supporting evidence for the long-lived agency
 motive.

 use high G-index and low insider ownership as measure for weak governance.
 They attempt to link governance and investment and payout decisions.
 Weak governance firms tend to hold less cash because they spend most of
 cash on M&A and expenditure.
 The interaction between governance and cash reserve suggests that the 
\emph on
spending effect
\emph default
 is stronger with the presence of excess cash.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With respect to payout decisions, firms with weak governance tend to repurchase
 rather than cash dividend.
 They also have no commitment to maintain future dividend stream.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph*
Conflict of agency and cash holdings (or public vs.
 private firms' cash holding)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Weak-governed firms tend to overinvest.
 Among public firms, weak-governed firms tend to spend excess cash in other
 asset forms (e.g., in M&A) and well-governed firms tend to payout or reduce
 leverage.
 However, the speed of spending of weak-governed firms are faster than the
 speed of payout and relax leverage of well-governed firms.
 Thus, weak-governed firms also set a high target level of cash to have
 more freedom from external monitoring.
 As a results, higher agency conflicts lead to a higher cash holdings of
 public firms compared to private firms

.
 Some important findings of this paper is:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Despite financing frictions (less access to external finance) and higher
 precautionary motive, private firms hold about half as much cash as public
 firms.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The driver of this finding is because public firms have higher agency problems.
 Thus, public first set a higher targe cash level than the private firms.
 This is because entrenched managers, who prefer more internal financial
 slack, appear to set higher target cash level.

 due to this excess cash, compared to private firms, public firms tend to
 spend cash via investment in a myopic way and reduce firm operating performance.
 Thus, more severe agency cost leads public firms spend excess cash in a
 less efficient way.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
By increasing investment, poorly governed public firms have higher speed
 of adjustment away from excess cash than do well-governed public firms.

 It means that the public firms have lower SOA than their private peers.

\begin_layout Section
Diversification and cash holdings
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Professor Duchin has a bunch of work relating to diversification.
 Some of them relate to the cash holdings.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "duchin2010cashholdings"

\end_inset

 propose the relation between cross-divisional correlation of investment
 opportunities and financing deficit/gap (Q-CF correlation) and cash flows
 could affect the diversified firms' cash holdings.
 If cross-divisional Q and CF correlation are lower, these firms are well-divers
ified and have coinsurance effect so they have less incentive to hold cash
 fow precautionary motive.
 If Q-CF correlation is higher, firms have less financing gap, so the hold
 less cash.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This finding could be explained by the governance and cross-divisional transfer.
 In good governance and in firms with high transfer, firms hold less cash.

 provide evidence that CEO allocate more capital to divisional managers
 with high social connection to him.
 This finding could be explained by two hypotheses: (i) favoritism hypothesis
 and (ii) information hypothesis.
 These two hypotheses have contrasting predictions to firm value: favoritism
 predicts negative value and information predicts a positive effect.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In well-governed and high information asymmetric firms, divisional managers
 tend to give more valuable information/advice to CEOs, social connection
 between them gives more efficient investment and higher firm value.
 In contrast, at firms with poor governance, the social connection between
 them negatively affects investment efficiency and firm value.
 This paper, thus, clearly show the both bright side and dark side of diversific
ation.

 find a very interesting figure.
 Risky assets represent 40% of firmsâ€™ financial portfolios, or 6% of total
 book assets.
 This effect is concentrated among financial unconstrained firms, weak governanc
e, and are discounted by 13% to 22% compared to safe assets.

Save cash when financial constrained firms have future growth opportunities
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 propose the cash flow sensitivity of cash as a new measure of financial
 constraint.
 The idea is that financial constrained firms save cash for future projects
 so the cash flow sensitivity of cash will be positive for constrained firms,
 while non-financial constrained firms do not necessary have the same characteri
stics.
